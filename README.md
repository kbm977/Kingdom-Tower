Game Concept: PP-3-2 Tower defence
The concept of the game is to protect the castle from the goblins and the ogres to do so you must build towers acquire knights, engineers and wizards to help you.
Game Overview
● Deploy your troops.
● Strategies and plan for the enemies to come and fight you.
● Earn orbs by defeating the goblins and ogres or by protecting your castle by building towers.
● Use orbs to upgrade and deploy knights and wizards’ units and climb up the skill tree.
● Manage resources to better fit your plan.
Gameplay Mechanics
​Deploying Troops:
Players can deploy and develop 3 types of troops: Knights, Wizards, and Engineers.
 
-Knights are close ranged attackers. They are the first line of defense used against the goblins.
 
-Wizards on the other hand, can attack from a far. They slow down enemies' movement and attacking speed, but they can’t slow down big enemies. They also deal damage but not as much as knights do.
 
-Engineers are non combat troops. They are responsible for building the towers. They are defenseless though, they need protection.

Non-playable. Mark expected given marking scheme (out of 15%):10%
• 1- there are 2 types of enemy troops: goblins and ogres. Goblins are fast and come in groups, but the wizard can slow their speed down which makes them easier to kill. Ogres are heavy and strong, they cant be affected by the wizards magic. Which makes the knights as the appropriate troop choice against them.
• 2- the king plays a narrative role in the game as he guides the player and gives information about the enemies and the game rules
Aesthetics. Mark expected given marking scheme (out of 15%): 10%
• The orb animation (also used in the skip timer button) is an original asset created in adobe photoshop and adobe premiere pro.
• The troops and towers are online assets that help with the cartoonish lowpoly aesthetic. The castle was customised by flipping the tower model and adjusting it as needed.
